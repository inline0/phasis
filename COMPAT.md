## Runner Caveats

- Feature families listed in config/support.php are skipped before execution.
- Tests flagged as module are executed as ES modules (always strict, import/export processed).
- Tests flagged as async are skipped by the current runner.
- Mixed-mode tests currently run only in sloppy mode unless onlyStrict or noStrict is set.
- Chunks that timeout, OOM, or crash are split automatically until a single-file blocker is isolated.
