## Runner Caveats

- Feature families listed in config/support.php are skipped before execution.
- Tests flagged as module are executed as ES modules (always strict, import/export processed).
- Tests flagged as async are skipped by the current runner.
- Mixed-mode tests currently run only in sloppy mode unless onlyStrict or noStrict is set.
- Chunks that timeout, OOM, or crash are split automatically until a single-file blocker is isolated.

## Explicitly Skipped Feature Families

- `import-defer`
- `source-phase-imports`
- `import-attributes`
- `json-modules`
- `cross-realm`
- `top-level-await`
- `resizable-arraybuffer`
- `regexp-duplicate-named-groups`
- `tail-call-optimization`
- `regexp-v-flag`
- `regexp-modifiers`
- `regexp-lookbehind`
